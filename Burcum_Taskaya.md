### About Me ###
I'm a double major student in Department of Computer Engineering  and study Department of Chemical Engineering in Marmara University.
I also work at Turkcell as a part-time Business Intelligence Administration.

My thesis is about Android Application based on Text to Speech and I want to develop myself at this area. Iâ€™m the kind of person who likes to be busy, so double majoring is good for me!
