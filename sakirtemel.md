### About me ###

I'm Sakir, a senior student in Computer Science. I started coding when I was 11, from that age on, I always try to improve myself in different areas.

I'm happy to be here, we have courses which ease our learning process.

Besides computers, I like travelling. I spent my last year at Warsaw, Poland as an ERASMUS student. And I've visited some cities in Europe like Paris, Berlin, Budapest, and some another.


Usually I am interested in the applications of computers in business, and modern daily life.
